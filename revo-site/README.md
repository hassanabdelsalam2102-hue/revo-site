# REVO React Site (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind)

## Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes
- React Router is used for page routes (no Next.js).
- Images are in `public/assets/img`.
- Contact form is frontend-only: it validates, saves locally, and offers an Email fallback (mailto).
